8Subject: Request for Adjustment of Office Timings Due to College Classes

Dear Sir/Mam,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that I will be attending classes at my college starting from May 24, 2024. My class schedule is as follows:

Tuesday: 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM
Wednesday: 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM
In light of this schedule, I kindly request your approval to adjust my office timings on these days. I propose the following adjustments:

On Tuesdays, I will come to the office after my classes, starting at 2:00 PM and work till 06:00 pm .
On Wednesdays, I will start my workday earlier to accommodate the 1:30 PM class.

Please let me know if these proposed adjustments are acceptable or if any further modifications are needed. I am committed to ensuring that my academic commitments do not interfere with my responsibilities at work and will make every effort to fulfill my duties effectively.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your response.

Thanks and  regards,

Aishwarya Raj Tyagi
